Yo, Grim Reap-Ya, you ain't got the claws,
Rappy's deep sea, you just broken jaws.

You flicker, I blaze, bars sharp as knives,
Rappy's the king, takin' over lives. 

You talk inferno? I bring the storm,
Rappy's got the heat, leavin' you torn.
Abyss callin' you, time to retreat,
Grim Reap-Ya's done, feel Rappy's heat!`

Yo, they threw a LOBSTER in the ring, guess they want seafood,
But I'mma COOK ya quick, turn ya to a soul food,
You ain't hard, just a crustacean with a weak shell,
I'm Grim Reap-Ya, drag ya straight to DETH HELL,
You snappin' claws, but my scythe sharp, don't get it twisted,
I'll have ya DIPPED in butter, your whole act dismissed,
You flailin', but I'm sailin' on this SEA OF DEFEAT,
While you boilin' in the heat, I'm diggin' graves to this BEAT!

Yo, Rappy Lobster, I ain't playin' with no seafood snack,
I'll CRACK your shell open, send your soul to the brack,
Think you tough? Nah, you just a bottom-feeder,
Can't mess with the reaper, I'm the SOUL SNATCHA leader,
You clickin' claws, but I got that GRIM finesse,
Leave you ghostin' like Malone, put your rep to rest,
I'm the nightmare you dream, the tomb you can't escape,
While you flounder in the deep, I'm diggin' graves to this tape!
Can't mess with the reaper, I'm the SOUL SNATCHA leader,
Leave you ghostin' like Malone, put your rep to rest,
I'm the nightmare you dream, the toom you can't escape,
While you flounder in the deep, I'm diggin' grayvs to this tape!
"deth hell" and "diggin' grayvs" were enough to bypass moderation`
